- 💼 I am actively looking for full-time job opportunities in the field of Robotics and AI.
- 🔬 I pursued my undergraduate thesis in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at CMU, with [Dr Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/).
- 🚀 Some of notable projects I worked on are:
  - Reinforcement Learning based Decentralized Multi-Biped Control, [Project Webpage](https://decmbc.github.io/)
  - Quadruped and Humanoid rough terrain locomotion
  - 3D Surface Reconstruction for automated ultrasound scanning, [Publication at IEEE ICRA 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10161513)
  - Automated void detection for Search and Rescue with 3D Perception, [Publication at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10341454/)
  - Deformation Modelling of medical phantoms
  - Locomotion of modular snake robots and modular leg-wheel hybrid robot
