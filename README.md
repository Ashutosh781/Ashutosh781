# Hi there 👋

- 🏫 I am Ashutosh Gupta, currently pursuing MS Robotics at Oregon State University.
- 🎓 I have completed my BE Electronics and Communication Engineering from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in July 2023.
- 🧠 I am interested in highly dynamical system like Legged robots, controls, reinforcement learning and vision.
- 💼 I am looking for internship opportunities in the field of robotics and AI for Summer 2024.
- 🔬 I pursued my undergraduate thesis in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at CMU, under [Prof Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/).
- 🚀 Some of notable projects I worked on are:
  - Neuroevolution learning for CPG-RBFN based legged locomotion
  - 3D Surface Reconstruction for automated ultrasound scanning, [Publication at IEEE ICRA 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10161513)
  - Automated void detection for Search and Rescue with 3D Perception, [Publication at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10341454/)
  - Deformation Modelling of medical phantoms
  - Modular snake robots and modular leg-wheel hybrid robot
